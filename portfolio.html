	<p>The following works are projects I created in the DIG2000 class. I learned many things on how to create Photoshop images, Premiere Pro videos, and a website with HTML.</p>

	<h5>This is my Photoshop collage I created with layers. It was my first time using Photoshop for a full assignment, where I was able to apply the skills we learned in class.</h5>
