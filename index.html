		<p>Hello! My name is Erin, and I am currently in college studying graphic design. My creative vision is heavily influenced by cyberpunk-esque aesthetics, and much of my inspiration comes from various cartoons, video games, and fictional media. My specialty is character illustration and design.</p>

		<p>Please take a moment to review a few samples of my work. While I am most proficient with Procreate, I am also familiar with Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and have some experience with HTML and CSS.</p>
